# IOT-BASED-AUTONOMOUS-AIR-QUALITY-ANALYZER-AND-PURIFIER

Abstract — This research outlines an Automatic Air Quality Analyzer and Purifier based on the Internet of Things (IoT) that monitors air quality as well as improves it in an automated way. The device consists of several gas sensors to identify the concentration of critical pollutants in air (e.g., VOCs, CO₂, and CO) and determines the air quality index (AQI) level in real-time. When AQI is determined, the device is designed to automatically move to the area with the highest AQI to facilitate purification to the theatre area. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller is used for the movement and automation of the purification methods and is controlled by an L298N motor driver with DC motors for directional movement. Real time AQI monitoring and notifications are sent to an IoT mobile-app to provide AQI update. The prototype device demonstrates a practical near cost-free portable automated solution for air purification in smart homes and environmental monitoring.
